# House_Price_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the sale prices of houses based on various features.

# Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence house prices and build a predictive model to estimate the prices of houses. The project involves the following steps:

- Data Collection: Gathering a dataset containing relevant information about houses, such as size, location, number of rooms, amenities, etc.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identifying patterns, correlations, and important features that may affect house prices.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving the most important information.
- Model Development: Building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the transformed feature space obtained from PCA.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error, R-squared, or root mean squared error, to determine the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
- Model Deployment: Implementing the trained model into a real-world application, making it accessible for users to estimate house prices based on input data.
